<h2>
<p>Audi AG is a German automobile manufacturer that designs, engineers, produces, markets and distributes luxury vehicles.</p> 
<p>Audi is a subsidiary of Volkswagen Group and has its roots at Ingolstadt, Bavaria, Germany.</p>
<p>Audi vehicles are produced in nine production facilities worldwide.</p>
<p>The origins of the company are complex, going back to the early 20th century and the initial enterprises (Horch and the Audiwerke) founded by engineer August Horch; and two other manufacturers (DKW and Wanderer), leading to the foundation of Auto Union in 1932.</p>
<p>The modern era of Audi essentially began in the 1960s when Auto Union was acquired by Volkswagen from Daimler-Benz.</p>
<p>After relaunching the Audi brand with the 1965 introduction of the Audi F103 series, Volkswagen merged Auto Union with NSU Motorenwerke in 1969, thus creating the present-day form of the company.</p></h2>
