<h2>
<p>Mercedes-Benz  commonly referred to as Mercedes, is both a German automotive brand and, from late 2019 onwards, a subsidiary – as Mercedes-Benz AG – of Daimler AG.</p>
<p>Mercedes-Benz is known for producing luxury vehicles and commercial vehicles.</p>
<p>The headquarters is in Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg.</p>
<p>The first Mercedes-Benz brand name vehicles were produced in 1926. In 2018, Mercedes-Benz was the largest seller of premium vehicles in the world, having sold 2.31 million passenger cars.</p>
<p>The company's origins come from Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft's 1901 Mercedes and Karl Benz's 1886 Benz Patent-Motorwagen, which is widely regarded as the first internal combustion engine in a self-propelled automobile.</p>
<p>The fuel was not gasoline, but rather a much more volatile petroleum spirit called ligroin.</p>
<p>The slogan for the brand is "the best or nothing".</p></h2>
